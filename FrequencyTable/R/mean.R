# The idea is to have
# a table which we identify as a DiscreteFrequencyTable.
# We can have Integer and Real valued versions to identify
# the fact that the values in the names of the table
# are integers or real value.
#
# We use the DiscreteFrequencyTable class to differentiate from
# a generic table whose names may not be numbers.
#
#
# Define methods for merge() or + to combine two or more of these tables.
# Also define method for median, and quantile() generally.
#
#
# Also, define a function to create these types of tables.
# They will be specific to the source of the data.
# But the function(s) will set the class of the table
# with
